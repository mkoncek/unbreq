= Unbreq

Detector of unused `BuildRequires` of RPM builds.

== Building

Build the project:

----
$ make all
----

Either install or install symlink of the Python plugin and the executable file watcher:

----
# make install
----

----
# make install-link
----

To uninstall:

----
# make uninstall
----

== Usage

NOTE: This project is in a very early stage.

This project is currently implemented as a mock plugin.
The native part uses `fanotify` to watch filesystem accesses.

To run it, install it and then enable it from the command line:

----
mock --enable-plugin=unbreq
----

In logs you should see messages like:

----
INFO: enabled unbreq plugin
----

If Unbreq detects an unneeded `BuildRequire` it prints a message like:

----
Unbreq plugin: the following BuildRequires were not used: ${packages}
----
